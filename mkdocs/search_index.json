Whether your digital identity comprises a mugshot or a 256 bit hexadecimal address, validation and verification are still a requisite. Even on the decentralized, pseudonymous web, in which real world identities are optional, reputation still counts. The web 3.0 isn\u2019t about concealing everyone under a cloak of invisibility; rather it\u2019s about giving individuals the right to privacy. The freedom to choose which data they disclose to which platforms, rather than having it hoovered up by every app they install and website they join, to be stored in centralized silos that are a honeypot to hackers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can Aragon create a fairer world?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion pieces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nZurpples / @Zurpples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuddenly it\u2019s 2020.

A new hotel gleams in the distance of a new city where North and South are collaborating. The entire map of the city (and who did what) is stored securely in the blockchain, crypto is the currency of the region, and people trying to get rich off of exploitation are quickly found out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse More Articles\n\n\n\n\nRecent Classifieds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper Relations opening at Aragon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are looking for a developer relations to help third party developers create apps on top of the Aragon DApp and aragonOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHead of Communications at Web3 Foundation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Head of Communications will help Web3 establish a profile by which to attract the best strategic, educational, and academic partners, and give prominence to the ideas they champion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse More Classifieds",

A DAICO contract is published by a single development team that wishes to raise funds for a project. The DAICO contract starts off in \u201ccontribution mode\u201d, specifying a mechanism by which anyone can contribute ETH to the contract, and get tokens in exchange. This could be a capped sale, an uncapped sale, a dutch auction, an interactive coin offering, a KYC\u2019d sale with dynamic per-person caps, or whatever other mechanism the team chooses. Once the contribution period ends, the ability to contribute ETH stops, and the initial token balances are set; from there on the tokens can become tradeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Aragon Nest\n\n\nNotes on Blockchain Governance\n\n\nDistrict Proposal Spotlight \u2014The Bloom Lending District\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon\n\n\nDAOs\n\n\ndistrict0x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nTatu K\u00e4rki\n on Dec 6\n\n\nAuthor \nVitalik Buterin\n on Dec 17\n\n\nAuthor \nP.J.

This district will offer a standardized, transparent, peer-to-peer method for requesting and funding loans, allowing anyone with access to the internet to lend and borrow funds free of central influence.

These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\nBringing private data to user-governed marketplaces.\n At district0x, we have thus far largely avoided this issue by building marketplaces which rely mostly on already public cryptographic data (Name Bazaar), or relatively static information users are already comfortable making public (like freelancer or employer profiles on Ethlance). Where we\u2019ve had to protect private data for supporting services within districts, we\u2019ve done so with purpose-built solutions.\n\n\nAuctus announces their plans to use and integrate with Aragon.\n By deploying Auctus on the Aragon Network, it will be possible to protect Auctus and it\u2019s community from any intermediary trying to abuse its power. Furthermore, it will avoid misunderstandings between agents, keeping full record of all decision making and financial decisions. It will also allow Auctus to become truly community driven, increasing the number of stakeholders, as well as decentralizing decision making and operational processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q4 Development Update\n\n\nAragon Q4 Transparency Report\n\n\nAn Introduction to district0x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon\n\n\nAragon\n\n\ndistrict0x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nJorge Izquierdo\n on Jan 11\n\n\nAuthor \nTatu K\u00e4rki\n on Jan 17\n\n\nAuthor \nMatt Breen\n on Jan 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress of development from the last quarter of 2017.\n In the last quarter of 2017 we were heads down developing everything for the version 0.5 release of the Aragon Core app. Lots of progress was made, first audit of the smart contracts was conducted with good results and we\u2019re on track to get the testnet release out really soon\u2122.

This district will offer a standardized, transparent, peer-to-peer method for requesting and funding loans, allowing anyone with access to the internet to lend and borrow funds free of central influence.

Where we\u2019ve had to protect private data for supporting services within districts, we\u2019ve done so with purpose-built solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nSubmit News!",

Let\u2019s dive in\u2026\n\n\nOur Vision\n\n\nEverything we\u2019re building is to challenge the current ownership structures of our world\u2019s communities and marketplaces. We work together everyday to lower the bar of entry so anyone can do this as well.\n\n\nWe believe there is a better world within grasp and \nwe value\n the visions of the people that think differently about our future. With each new partnership and community member we\u2019re building a network effect that will move us forward to these shared goals.\n\n\nHow Will We Achieve This?\n\n\nWith each development, we\u2019re progressively building what we call d0xINFRA, a standard framework that will power the underlying network. We\u2019re building d0xINFRA by utilizing already established curation market models like a \u2018\nToken Curated Registry\n\u2019 within our \nDistrict Registry\n, utilizing distributed marketplace concepts (\nUber\n, \nUpwork\n, and \nAirb\nb\n) and allowing for open modular governance models by using \nAragon\n.\n\n\nEach district we launch will be a core component of d0xINFRA:\n\n\n\n\nEthlance\n - Search, filtering, posting, listing, ranking and reputation\n\n\nName Bazaar\n - Core framework/contracts for the d0xINFRA network\n\n\nMeme Factory\n - Curation functions, community functions, will be one of the first district registries, and will decentralize a crypto-collectible model that currently operates successfully with centralized parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Staking Interface\n\n\nAfter the Aragon mainnet launch, we will deploy a staking interface that allows DNT holders to participate in open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for each of the markets that come online. When a district is created, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can interact with through the staking mechanism. After staking you will receive voting rights in that district.\n\n\nWhat is the District Creation Interface?\n\n\nThe creation interface can be described as the WordPress of dApps, the districts we\u2019re launching are like wordpress templates, while auxiliary modules can be seen as WordPress plugins to extend functionality. This will all come together after the core d0xINFRA framework is online. This will dramatically lower the bar of entry for anyone wanting to remove central power structures from any marketplace they can dream up, even if they aren\u2019t a developer.\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nAragon will be utilized as a governance layer and enable the ability to stake DNT to districts. It will also allow us to start building out district-specific governance functions. People will stake DNT in those varying governance models.\n\n\nSome governance models that we will likely see:\n\n\n\n\nTime based staking\n\n\nStake weighted\n\n\nMeritocracy and reputation hybrids\n\n\nFutarchy\n\n\nLiquid democracy or delegate style governance\n\n\n\n\nWhen you stake DNT to a district you will be granted access to the Aragon entity\u2019s voting rights. Considering the modular nature of Aragon, the benefit of staking will be different depending on the individual district.\n\n\nExamples of things that governance participants could potentially control:\n\n\n\n\nMonetization\n\n\nDistrict design\n\n\nGovernance structure\n\n\nBylaws\n\n\nAuxiliary modules utilized\n\n\nUtilization of fees and development funding\n\n\nReputation systems\n\n\nDevelopment roadmaps\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThe end result will be a world where you can create a market that suits your needs, where market participants have the say as much as anyone else and no central power structure can dictate how the market works. We want anyone in the world to have access to the benefits that decentralization brings. The district0x network is yours and we can\u2019t wait to see what you build.\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\nFor more information about the \ndistrict0x Network\n:\n- Check out our \nwhite paper\n\n- Watch our \nintroduction video\n\n- Subscribe for \nemail updates\n\n- Follow us on \nTwitter\n\n- Join us on \nTelegram\n\n- Subscribe to our \nsubreddit\n\n- See our \nlive stream recordings\n on YouTube",

            "text": "Thoughts On Governance and Network Effects\n\n\nAuthor \nLuke Duncan / @lkngtn\n\n\nThis article was originally posted in the \nAragon Blog\n on Dec 12 2017\n\n\n\n\nThis post discusses \ngovernance\n and its impact on \nnetwork effects\n and why both relate to how value flows and is captured within tokenized blockchain networks.\n\n\nHardware, Software, and Data are commoditized by decentralization\n\n\nThe process of commoditization turns a good or service which is highly differentiated or even unique into a fungible resource, where differences between the commodity offered by sellers in a market are low. Commoditized markets are associated with declining prices and narrow profit margins, as competitors struggle to differentiate their offerings and instead rely on price-based competition.\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n: \nEthereum\n lets you pay for computation and storage on an as-needed basis by paying gas. Projects like \nGolem\n, \nStorj\n, \nTruebit\n, and others aim to further commoditize hardware through decentralized networks. Products that build on these technologies cannot rely on specialized hardware as a key differentiator.\n\n\nSoftware\n: Open source software is commoditized, there is no difference between one instance of public code versus another instance of the same code. Since the only applications that make sense to run on a blockchain are those that benefit from trust-minimization, public source code is the standard.\n\n\nData\n: Decentralized applications rely on publicly available data sources, otherwise there is no way for the public to validate transactions. Privacy technology such as \nzk-Snarks\n may obscure public visibility, but the encrypted dataset that enables a shared state remains public.\n\n\n\n\nProducts or services offered in a market like this will either compete on price, quickly driving profit margins down or seek out new ways to differentiate themselves.\n\n\nOne way to differentiate is to issue a token\n, even if you don\u2019t otherwise need one. Having a token allows you to create a network effect around your product, people who hold this token will have a vested interest and prefer your product over alternatives. They will be your biggest advocates, they will shill your product to all their friends, who will jump on the band wagon, and do the same to their friends\u2026 and on and on. Or maybe not\u2026\n\n\nIf the market is commoditized and your competitors have at best an equivalent product to yours, issuing a token and requiring it to be used in order to access your product works (sort of like an \nAPI key\n). However, by forcing the use of a token when your application doesn\u2019t require one you create a worse user experience because the user\u2019s effective cost is unpredictable. Now if a competitor offers the same product without the restriction, it isn\u2019t equivalent, it is objectively better. Therefore, differentiation in this way may work to some degree, but is not particularly defensible.\n\n\nDefensible tokenization\n\n\nIn a \ndefensible token model\n you cannot remove the token or replace it with a different token and create a better user experience.\n\n\nTo help reason about the \ndefensibility\n of different tokenization models, identifying a baseline that all defensible token models have in common is helpful:\n\n\n\n\nA\n: Fees are justified for \nservices provided\n. The execution of arbitrary smart-contract code does not justify paying fees in excess of the gas used to validate/mine transactions.\n\n\nB\n: It is not defensible to force the usage of a token in such a way that the application would work \nequally well or better using a different token\n. (e.g. a stable coin, or ETH)\n\n\nC\n: Tokens which are uniquely \nrequired\n to incentivize or disincentivize behavior in order \nto provide a service\n accrue value relative to that services utility.\n\n\n\n\nIf we agree on these statements we can immediately throw out many tokenization strategies. For example \na token whose primary utility is to be the exclusive\n \nmedium of exchange\n for transactions within a network violates all three of these statements. \n[A]\n because having to convert to the native token is an \narbitrary fee\n unrelated to a service. \n[B]\n because in a market that requires a medium of exchange, a stable token that \neveryone already has\n works far better than the application\u2019s native token. \n[C]\n because the token is not inherently linked to the incentivization of agents \nperforming\n a service.\n\n\nWe can also look at some models which do not violate any of these statements. Proof of Work, \nProof of Stake\n, \ndecentralized oracles\n, \nToken Curated Registries\n. Each instance of these mechanisms requires its own unique token to make the crypto-economic incentives align between multiple parties. Defensible tokenization exists at the blockchain protocol level (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) and at the blockchain application layer (decentralized oracles, Token Curated Registries).\n\n\nThe key difference is not whether the product is a protocol or an application, but whether the network effect driven by tokenization is defensible or not.\n\n\nHowever, having a defensible token model is not sufficient to maintain a strong \nnetwork effect\n. Token balances can be copied by competitors, software and datasets can be forked, \nhow do you ensure that your token holders are loyal and will continue to prefer your service over that of competitors?\n\n\nLoyalty is everything\n\n\nNetworks are \nanti-rival\n with network effects that push towards \nmonopolistic competition\n, but commoditization driven by decentralization pushes the market towards \nperfect competition\n. Decentralized networks will either be wildly successful, or have minimal value, and the biggest factor is how well the network is able to nurture its network effect.\n\n\nWe can understand this effect from the perspective of an individual participant using \nAlbert Hirchman\u2019s theory\n of \nExit, Voice, and Loyalty\n. The theory says that an individual who perceives a decline in the benefit of remaining within a group may respond by \nExit, leaving the group\n, or \nVoice, by proposing changes that would increase their benefit\n.\n\n\nIn the context of networks built on blockchains the individual may exit by either selling their tokens, or by forking and creating a competitive product.\n\n\nSomeone who is considering quitting Facebook not only has to quit they have to start a new service from scratch without any user accounts or data. Blockchain networks are different, a fork can replicate not just the applications software, but also the state. Now the user can quit and move over to a perfect alternative, and they can more easily convince their friends to switch as well, there is \nsignificantly less friction for exit in the context of blockchain-based networks\n.\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there is no friction when exiting, network effects have inertia and most participants prefer to stay on whichever network the majority of their peers support. However, if we acknowledge that the biggest barrier to a fork is the desire to maintain a network effect, \nthan we come to the conclusion that we must maximize Voice of network participants.\n\n\nThe best way to maximize voice is through effective governance.\n\n\nThe Governance Imperative\n\n\nGovernance processes may be formal or informal, on-chain or off-chain, the exact details are less important so long as the process is effective and legitimate enough to maintain loyalty and attract more new network constituents over time.\n\n\nUnion Square Ventures \npointed to governance as the new basis for competion\n nearly ten years ago. Fred Ehrsam\u2019s recent \npost on governance\n suggests that blockchain networks will result in a \nCambrian explosion\n of governance processes. In a tokenized ecosystem that enables rapid experimentation with governance processes, improving our governance processes is imperative. Anything that relies on a governance process today \nmust\n be willing and able to rapidly adopt new processes or risk being left behind by the competition.\n\n\nThe processes that are \u201ceffective and legitimate\u201d enough today may not be as soon as it becomes common knowledge that a better alternative exists.\n\n\nIn some cases our existing structures are complex, emergent, and not well documented and as Vlad Zamfir\u2019s recent post \nagainst moving to on-chain governance\n for Ethereum points out replacing something you don\u2019t fully understand with something you do is not necessarily wise. In other cases we are confident our current processes are problematic and need to be replaced as quickly as possible.\n\n\nDApp developers face the challenge of writing applications that need to be \nfuture-proof\n despite being deployed in an environment still under development. They must decide between immutability and upgradeability. Despite their best efforts bugs may be found in production, and it would be good if fixes could be applied quickly. Even if they choose to write immutable contracts, if users typically access their contracts through a DNS and \nENS\n pointer, then a governance process is needed to manage that change.\n\n\nFor a product to be decentralized, \nit must be impossible for a single individual or small team to unilaterally\n make changes. Current approaches to govern smart-contract upgradeability such as using a multi-sig are highly centralized. Whereas adopting tokenized governance transfers the authority of changes that impact the community to the community itself.\n\n\nDApp developers will likely be the earliest and most successful adopters of tokenized governance models. At first this may simply be a way to \nsecurely update smart contracts\n, but it should expand to more abstract decisions that attract and maintain a community\u2019s network effect both at the application and at the protocol layer.\n\n\nGovernance as a Service (GaaS)\n\n\nGovernance as a Service (GaaS) is a tokenization model where the primary utility of a token is governance over the protocol, application, or network.\n\n\nToken holders are the only party whose interest we can programmatically quantify. Other relevant parties exist, including users, developers, miners, and validators, but their interests in the network are not programatically quantifiable. By entrusting decisions which impact the network to token holders, they become the \nkeepers\n of the network effect. The service they are providing is formal representation of the informal interests of all network participants.\n\n\n\n\nThe model is defensible because \n[A]\n fees can be justified for the service token holders provide (making decisions that ensure the long term sustainability and growth of the network). If token holders do a bad job, or charge excessive fees, the network will fail, but if they do a good job they will be able to adapt to changing market conditions and be more resilient to the effects of commoditization. \n[B]\n Properties like stability are not critical to participating in governance. \n[C]\n Using a unique token is required because it quantifies a users influence in order to align incentivizes to ensure the service provided is consistent.\n\n\nThe value of a governance token accrues relative to the importance of the decisions being made. The more people that use the product and rely on its functionality, the more important critical decisions become, the more value will flow to the governance token.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIf you\u2019re building a product that relies on a network effect, creating a governance token or adding governance privileges to your existing token can be incredibly powerful. It increases voice for participants and makes the network effects more resilient.\n\n\nThere are many promising approaches to token based governance including \nquadratic voting\n, \nliquid democracy\n, \nfutarchy\n, and many forms of \nmeritocracy\n that warrant attention.\n\n\nEach process has different strengths and weaknesses, some which are obvious and others which may require experimental implementations to uncover.\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the ideal governance mechanism is, or if there is even an effective one-size-fits all mechanism. It is clear, however, that \nfinding better mechanisms is extremely valuable\n.\n\n\nAt \nAragon\n we are building infrastructure to support these experiments. \naragonOS\n allows for governance applications to be built and shared between organizations, and privileges can be set such that more experimental models can be tried in limited capacities at first and gradually given more authority. This will enable us to bring continuous improvement processes from the software world into the realm of economics and social sciences, while maintaining acceptable levels of risk.\n\n\nTo keep up with the progress of\u00a0Aragon:\n\n\n\n\nCome chat with us at the \nAragon Chat\n\n\nFollow Aragon on \nTwitter\n\n\nSubscribe to the \nAragon subreddit\n\n\nFollow Aragon at \nLinkedIn\n\n\nContribute to Aragon at \nGitHub\n\n\nFind us on \nYoutube\n\n\nExplore the \nAragon Wiki",

            "text": "The process of commoditization turns a good or service which is highly differentiated or even unique into a fungible resource, where differences between the commodity offered by sellers in a market are low. Commoditized markets are associated with declining prices and narrow profit margins, as competitors struggle to differentiate their offerings and instead rely on price-based competition.   Hardware :  Ethereum  lets you pay for computation and storage on an as-needed basis by paying gas. Projects like  Golem ,  Storj ,  Truebit , and others aim to further commoditize hardware through decentralized networks. Products that build on these technologies cannot rely on specialized hardware as a key differentiator.  Software : Open source software is commoditized, there is no difference between one instance of public code versus another instance of the same code. Since the only applications that make sense to run on a blockchain are those that benefit from trust-minimization, public source code is the standard.  Data : Decentralized applications rely on publicly available data sources, otherwise there is no way for the public to validate transactions. Privacy technology such as  zk-Snarks  may obscure public visibility, but the encrypted dataset that enables a shared state remains public.   Products or services offered in a market like this will either compete on price, quickly driving profit margins down or seek out new ways to differentiate themselves.  One way to differentiate is to issue a token , even if you don\u2019t otherwise need one. Having a token allows you to create a network effect around your product, people who hold this token will have a vested interest and prefer your product over alternatives. They will be your biggest advocates, they will shill your product to all their friends, who will jump on the band wagon, and do the same to their friends\u2026 and on and on. Or maybe not\u2026  If the market is commoditized and your competitors have at best an equivalent product to yours, issuing a token and requiring it to be used in order to access your product works (sort of like an  API key ). However, by forcing the use of a token when your application doesn\u2019t require one you create a worse user experience because the user\u2019s effective cost is unpredictable. Now if a competitor offers the same product without the restriction, it isn\u2019t equivalent, it is objectively better. Therefore, differentiation in this way may work to some degree, but is not particularly defensible.",

            "text": "In a  defensible token model  you cannot remove the token or replace it with a different token and create a better user experience.  To help reason about the  defensibility  of different tokenization models, identifying a baseline that all defensible token models have in common is helpful:   A : Fees are justified for  services provided . The execution of arbitrary smart-contract code does not justify paying fees in excess of the gas used to validate/mine transactions.  B : It is not defensible to force the usage of a token in such a way that the application would work  equally well or better using a different token . (e.g. a stable coin, or ETH)  C : Tokens which are uniquely  required  to incentivize or disincentivize behavior in order  to provide a service  accrue value relative to that services utility.   If we agree on these statements we can immediately throw out many tokenization strategies. For example  a token whose primary utility is to be the exclusive   medium of exchange  for transactions within a network violates all three of these statements.  [A]  because having to convert to the native token is an  arbitrary fee  unrelated to a service.  [B]  because in a market that requires a medium of exchange, a stable token that  everyone already has  works far better than the application\u2019s native token.  [C]  because the token is not inherently linked to the incentivization of agents  performing  a service.  We can also look at some models which do not violate any of these statements. Proof of Work,  Proof of Stake ,  decentralized oracles ,  Token Curated Registries . Each instance of these mechanisms requires its own unique token to make the crypto-economic incentives align between multiple parties. Defensible tokenization exists at the blockchain protocol level (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) and at the blockchain application layer (decentralized oracles, Token Curated Registries).  The key difference is not whether the product is a protocol or an application, but whether the network effect driven by tokenization is defensible or not.  However, having a defensible token model is not sufficient to maintain a strong  network effect . Token balances can be copied by competitors, software and datasets can be forked,  how do you ensure that your token holders are loyal and will continue to prefer your service over that of competitors?",

            "text": "Networks are  anti-rival  with network effects that push towards  monopolistic competition , but commoditization driven by decentralization pushes the market towards  perfect competition . Decentralized networks will either be wildly successful, or have minimal value, and the biggest factor is how well the network is able to nurture its network effect.  We can understand this effect from the perspective of an individual participant using  Albert Hirchman\u2019s theory  of  Exit, Voice, and Loyalty . The theory says that an individual who perceives a decline in the benefit of remaining within a group may respond by  Exit, leaving the group , or  Voice, by proposing changes that would increase their benefit .  In the context of networks built on blockchains the individual may exit by either selling their tokens, or by forking and creating a competitive product.  Someone who is considering quitting Facebook not only has to quit they have to start a new service from scratch without any user accounts or data. Blockchain networks are different, a fork can replicate not just the applications software, but also the state. Now the user can quit and move over to a perfect alternative, and they can more easily convince their friends to switch as well, there is  significantly less friction for exit in the context of blockchain-based networks .  That\u2019s not to say that there is no friction when exiting, network effects have inertia and most participants prefer to stay on whichever network the majority of their peers support. However, if we acknowledge that the biggest barrier to a fork is the desire to maintain a network effect,  than we come to the conclusion that we must maximize Voice of network participants.  The best way to maximize voice is through effective governance.",

            "text": "Governance processes may be formal or informal, on-chain or off-chain, the exact details are less important so long as the process is effective and legitimate enough to maintain loyalty and attract more new network constituents over time.  Union Square Ventures  pointed to governance as the new basis for competion  nearly ten years ago. Fred Ehrsam\u2019s recent  post on governance  suggests that blockchain networks will result in a  Cambrian explosion  of governance processes. In a tokenized ecosystem that enables rapid experimentation with governance processes, improving our governance processes is imperative. Anything that relies on a governance process today  must  be willing and able to rapidly adopt new processes or risk being left behind by the competition.  The processes that are \u201ceffective and legitimate\u201d enough today may not be as soon as it becomes common knowledge that a better alternative exists.  In some cases our existing structures are complex, emergent, and not well documented and as Vlad Zamfir\u2019s recent post  against moving to on-chain governance  for Ethereum points out replacing something you don\u2019t fully understand with something you do is not necessarily wise. In other cases we are confident our current processes are problematic and need to be replaced as quickly as possible.  DApp developers face the challenge of writing applications that need to be  future-proof  despite being deployed in an environment still under development. They must decide between immutability and upgradeability. Despite their best efforts bugs may be found in production, and it would be good if fixes could be applied quickly. Even if they choose to write immutable contracts, if users typically access their contracts through a DNS and  ENS  pointer, then a governance process is needed to manage that change.  For a product to be decentralized,  it must be impossible for a single individual or small team to unilaterally  make changes. Current approaches to govern smart-contract upgradeability such as using a multi-sig are highly centralized. Whereas adopting tokenized governance transfers the authority of changes that impact the community to the community itself.  DApp developers will likely be the earliest and most successful adopters of tokenized governance models.
